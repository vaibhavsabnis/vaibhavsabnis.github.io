I am an electronics engineer by education and a software programmer by profession. I have lived in Mumbai, London and New York (past 7 years) with my wife and two daugthers (8y,4y).

Last few years of my life have been truly amazing! I have spent these watching my kids grow, and I just love it! 

I am passionate about Capital Markets, Software engineering and building and tinkering/fixing stuff. I love long drives (the backroads) and hindustani classical music. I am an amateur photographer and love take still-pics of natural landscapes and architecture. 

I am fairly fluent in Java and database technologies. 
Currently am spending some time teaching (and learning) the python programming language with my 8 year old daughter.
